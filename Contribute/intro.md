#Contributing to Scribus

So you want to give back to the Scribus community?  Great!!!  You have come to the right place to learn how to do so.

A number of different ways exist, and in this tutorial series we will get you started quickly.

## Tell us about a problem / missing feature

Just letting us know about a problem will make us very happy as we strive to make Scribus the best and most user-friendly DTP product out there.
A problem known about always beats a problem not known about.

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Visit the [issues page on GitHub for the scribus tutorials](https://github.com/scribusproject/scribus-tutorials/issues).
3. Search the issues to see if someone already talks about your problem.
4. Create a new issue if you can't find one.

## Fixing a problem
While we love to hear about problems, we love it even more to see those problems fixed.  Feel free to take a look at the issues already reported and see if you can do anything to help there.

In the following tutorials we will show you how you can do this (and make it very easy).  To make it even easier to get started, we have structured the tutorials into small discrete blocks so you can get started right away, even with the first tutorial.

In the first Tutorials we will go through the basics of contributing to this tutorial site, as we find this not only the easiest way to get started in learning the basics of Git, but also because we view good tutorials as important to fostering a healthy and engaged user-base.
